Adventure Works Dashboard with Machine Learning Integration
Scenario 

Adventure Works has assigned me the task of creating a dashboard that will provide a comprehensive overview of key business metrics and performance indicators to help make better decisions for the upcoming years. The requirements for this project are as follows:


- A comprehensive dashboard providing an overview of key business metrics and performance indicators.

- The dashboard should include an analysis of sales which displays the total sales, sales by product category, and sales trends over time. It should also provide a     breakdown of sales by region and customer segment.

- Customer insights are crucial, and the dashboard should showcase customer demographics such as age groups, location, and purchasing behavior. Additionally, it should identify high-value customers and their contribution to overall revenue.

- Inventory management should be monitored closely, and the dashboard should display product inventory levels, low stock alerts, and highlight fast-moving products. It should also include information on product shelf life and restocking requirements.

- Visualizing the supply chain process, from order placement to product delivery, is essential. The dashboard should provide insights on supplier performance and delivery times.

- Employee performance is equally important, and the dashboard should incorporate a section highlighting the performance of sales and support teams. It should also show individual and team achievements, response times, and customer satisfaction ratings.

- Lastly, the dashboard should integrate a machine learning model that can develop a predictive model to forecast future sales based on historical data.
